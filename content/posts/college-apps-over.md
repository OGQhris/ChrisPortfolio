# Short Spiel

More blogs are coming. Some may have been answers to prompts for my college applications. Obviously, not exactly the same, but still exploring the same topics, themes, and concepts I wrote about.

It was very frustrating to think of so many extra details for a prompt, yet be constrained to a small word limit. It felt like my writing was distilled. In these next few posts, I’ll be exploring the full undistilled versions of those topics.

Some of these prompts have been the most genuinely thought-provoking things I’ve thought about. Now that the 50, 100, 200, 300, etc… word limits are gone, I can finally just write to write.
