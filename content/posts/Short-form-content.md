# Shorter Form Content


I am going to start making my blogs shorter and easier for me to just type down the send. In my past blogs, I often thought through what I was going to write a lot, sat on it, wrote 1-2 drafts, and then I finally published it. There were two downsides to doing this: 

**Reason 1\.** It isn’t the 100% raw and true thoughts of what I am thinking. Oftentimes in my rounds of drafts and editing, I end up changing a few perspectives and key points in fear that something is too controversial or maybe even wrong. 

This mindset changed when I watched a video named “Scott Galloway’s TED Talk on How the Old Are Stealing from the Young.” This TED talk was very controversial, and had many points which I both agreed and disagreed with. I found that I could not agree with everything, but I could agree with the idea that I should not be afraid to say my full truth.

That is when I realized that my interest and satisfisfaction in watching that video wasn't being spoonfed information by this NYU professor, it was that I was being prompted to think on my own on my own thoughts on his stances. My blog shouldn’t be something that everyone should agree with, it should be something that people read and be prompted to think about their own perspectives. As I filtered and censored myself throughout the many rounds of iterations, I robbed not only my own desire to say my full truth, I robbed the reader’s opportunity to critically think. 

**Reason 2\.** I end up drafting the idea and never publishing it. On the left-hand side of my screen there are 14 subtabs on articles that I worked on, and I ended up not publishing because I sat on it for too long, and the fire burnt out.

One of my key philosophies in life is to do more and think less. I try to take action first, get my foot in the door, and see the few steps ahead of me, instead of the long path that daunts me. I found that this helps me learn how to adapt and to actually take action, instead of experiencing analysis paralysis. This is still a tough balance for me to strike, but in this case, I know that I could benefit more by doing more instead of thinking more. 

**Reason 2.5\.** I know you aren't reading all this, the attention span of everyone on earth is getting shorter and shorter, and I know you are much more inclined to read something that is shorter, rather than longer. Why do you think I seperate my texts so much?

# Bottom Line

Prepare to see a shift to shorter, less polished, and more controversial stances on topics. Prepare to disagree with my thoughts and writing more. In order for me to feel better about taking a more unforgiving approach in my writing, let me say this—think of this like a waiver of liability document for my writing: 

I think that some or most of what I say is correct, but what I do know for sure is that some of it is wrong. 

If you disagree with something or have something to say, I would love to hear your thoughts. Here’s my email: OGQhris@gmail.com
